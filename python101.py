# # Variables
# # -strings, letters, numbers or any stuff with a keyboard
# # a variable is just a way to refer to something else
# # variables do not make the program faster, they make the program slower
# # variables make it easier for us to write programs

# # Data Types:
# # - Programming languages see different types of variables differently
# # -string - english stuff
# # -numbers
# # floats, integers
# # -floats = it has a decimal in it 
# # -integer = has no decimal in it 
# # Booleans - true or false, off or on, 1 or 0, right or left, yes or no
# # list - a list of things, a single variable with a bunch of parts
# # dictionaries - a variable of variables
# # objects - super dictionaries

# # Primitive Date Types = string, number, Boolean

# month = "November";

# % = modulus. Modulus divides the number and gives you the remainder
