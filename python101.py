# # Variables
# # -strings, letters, numbers or any stuff with a keyboard
# # a variable is just a way to refer to something else
# # variables do not make the program faster, they make the program slower
# # variables make it easier for us to write programs

# print theBestClass

# # Data Types:
# # - Programming languages see different types of variables differently
# # -string - english stuff
# # -numbers
# # floats, integers
# # -floats = it has a decimal in it 
# # -integer = has no decimal in it 
# # Booleans - true or false, off or on, 1 or 0, right or left, yes or no
# # list - a list of things, a single variable with a bunch of parts
# # dictionaries - a variable of variables
# # objects - super dictionaries

# # Primitive Date Types = string, number, Boolean

# month = "November";
# print type(month);

# date = 13;
# print type(date);

# dateAsFloat = 13.0;
# print type(dateAsFloat);

# aBool = True;
# print type(aBool);

# aList = [];
# print type(aList);

# aDictionary = {};
# print type(aDictionary);

# # concatenate is programming speak for add things together
# first = "Sean";
# last = "McQuaid";
# fullName = first + " " + last
# print  fullName

# fourteen = 10 + 4;
# print fourteen

# fourteen = "10" + "4";

# # cast = change a variable to a new datetype
# fourteen = int("10") + 4;
# print fourteen

# math  = +, -, /, *, %
# % = modulus. Modulus divides the number and gives you the remainder
# ** = exponent
print 2 + 2
print 2 - 2 
print 2 / 2 
print 2 * 2 
print 2 % 2 
print 2 ** 3 
print "-" * 20 # gives you 20 of that particular string - give me x strings
